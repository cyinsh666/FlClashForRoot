## FlClashForRoot — `root` branch

This fork of [FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash) adds Android Root transparent proxy support.

- **Local and hotspot traffic:** proxy IPv4 TCP/UDP from selected apps and Wi-Fi hotspot clients, with separate switches for each scope. Existing profiles, routing rules and app selection are reused.
- **Root and VPN modes:** keep the original VPN mode and choose which mode to run.
- **Transparent proxy settings:** check Root authorization, view actual interception status, select the hotspot interface and restore network settings.
- **Dashboard card:** switch the Root mode setting and open the transparent proxy settings page.
- **Personalization:** enable “Hide quick start” to hide the floating start button, then long-press or right-click the **Dashboard navigation item** for the start/stop menu.
- **Startup:** the disclaimer page and its confirmation flow have been removed.

On a rooted Android device, open **Tools → Settings → Root transparent proxy** to configure the mode. The current implementation proxies IPv4; IPv6 is blocked for the selected scope. Reconnect existing hotspot clients after enabling hotspot interception so their network settings refresh.

**Download this fork:** get ARM32, ARM64 and universal APKs from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/cyinsh666/FlClashForRoot/releases/latest). The universal APK includes ARM32, ARM64 and x86_64.

**Scheduled builds:** the `root` branch builds Android Release APKs every day at **03:00 Asia/Shanghai**, using the configured Release signing key. After all three APKs pass verification, they are automatically published to GitHub Releases with a SHA256 checksum file. Each build keeps its own Release; [Actions artifacts](https://github.com/cyinsh666/FlClashForRoot/actions/workflows/android-root-release.yaml) are also retained for 14 days.

The documentation and download links below refer to the upstream FlClash project.

## Download

Get the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash/releases/latest), or open the
[website](https://chen08209.github.io/FlClash#download), which picks the right file for your device.

| Platform | Packages | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | APK for `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64` | Most phones use `arm64-v8a`. Also on the F-Droid repository below. |
| Windows 10 and later | Installer (`.exe`) or portable `.zip`, for x64 and ARM64 | Pick ARM64 on Snapdragon and other ARM laptops. |
| macOS 12 and later | DMG for Apple Silicon and Intel | Also on Homebrew. |
| Linux | `.deb`, `.rpm` and AppImage, for x64 and ARM64 | See the tray note below. |

</p>

**Homebrew**

```bash
brew tap chen08209/tap
brew install --cask flclash
```

**Linux tray icon**

The `.deb` package installs its own dependencies. With the AppImage or the `.rpm`, install the AyatanaAppIndicator
library so the tray icon can show:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libayatana-appindicator3-1   # Debian and Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libayatana-appindicator-gtk3     # Fedora
```

## Usage

**Import a profile from a link.** Opening a link in this form imports the subscription into FlClash. The `clashmeta://`
and `flclash://` schemes work the same way.

```text
clash://install-config?url=<URL-encoded subscription link>
```

**Automate on Android.** Tasker, MacroDroid and similar apps can start, stop or toggle the proxy by starting an
activity with one of these actions:

```text
com.follow.clash.action.START
com.follow.clash.action.STOP
com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

From a computer, the same works over adb:

```bash
adb shell am start -a com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

## Build from source

You need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 3.47 (release builds use 3.47.6),
[Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.27 and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed through rustup. Each platform builds on its own
host, except Android, which builds anywhere.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash.git
cd FlClash
flutter pub get
dart setup.dart android   # or windows, macos, linux
```

Packages land in `dist/`. The Go core and the Rust libraries are compiled as part of the Flutter build.

| Platform | Also needed |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android SDK with the NDK. Add `--arch arm64` to build a single ABI. |
| Windows | GCC (MinGW-w64) for the core and [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 6 for the installer. |
| macOS | Xcode and Node.js. The script installs `appdmg` through npm. |
| Linux | Debian or Ubuntu. The script installs the build packages with apt and downloads `appimagetool`. |

Run `dart setup.dart --help` for the remaining options, such as `--targets` to build only some package formats.
